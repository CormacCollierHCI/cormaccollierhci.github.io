    <h2>Design Manifesto</h2>

    <p>CS 3733, HCI, proved extremely valuable through our learning about the design process. Learning aspects as we went and then
    applying them in the projects that followed, presented an opportunity real experience while designing. I have compiled the 5 most important
    things I have learned.</p>

    <h4>Prototyping</h4>

    <p>One of the first aspects of the design process that we learned was prototyping. Our first group project, <a href="https://medium.com/@cormac.collier/design-for-feedback-c212af828ccc">Design For Others</a>
    , had a strong emphasis on prototyping, having to redesign an existing website for a specific group of people. My group was assigned to
    redesign for 70+ year old seniors, and we choose the Worcester Public Library. Our final project was to redesign using an interactive
    prototyping tool, Invision. Getting experience with this taught me how valuable it is to have not just a visual prototype, but rather
    one that you can apply your vision to and test how users can interact with it. In this project we also learned about the value of visual
    prototyping, sketching our early ideas on paper first. I was eager to get started using Invision, but if I had skipped the sketching phase,
    it would have made the next step much more difficult.</p>

    <h4>Design Tools</h4>

    <p>Another important point of designing that I learned throughout the course was how valuable it can be to have the right tools at your
    disposal while creating. This became especially apparent in <a href="https://medium.com/@corrinmcourville/design-for-tension-8fa1dcdc96dc">Design for Tension</a>
        and then later reinforced in <a href="https://medium.com/design-for-another-worldgroup-3/design-for-another-world-c2c25441c15e">Design for Another World</a>.
        In Design for Tension my group used FlowXO to make our chat bot,
    but we quickly found out just how difficult it was to use. It was extremely unintuitive, and the only tutorial we could find was made by
    FlowXO and just as difficult to use. Because of the poor design tools, this project was more difficult than it should have been. It
    also made clear to me home important it is to design with the end user in mind. As a creator you have to sure that someone with no prior
    knowledge of the product would know how to use it. When we worked on Design For Another World the tool we used, A-Frame, was extremely
    easy to use and had tutorials that were extremely informative. This made the project far more enjoyable because we could focus on our vision,
    rather than struggling to create it.</p>

    <h4>User Testing</h4>

    <p>The third point I would like to emphasize is the value of User Testing. Without in depth user testing, a product can be rendered virtually
        useless. Although I could have guessed this before taking HCI, it was driven into me through experience whilst designing my own
    products. All of our projects needed user testing to know that they were use-able but one especially important project was
        <a href="https://medium.com/@corrinmcourville/design-for-tension-8fa1dcdc96dc">Design for Tension</a>. This was because the whole
        project relied on a conversation between the product and the user. We found many faults in our chat bot during our demo day, when users would
    perform actions we hadn't anticipated, such as an obvious response that we had overlooked. Another value of user testing that I learned is
    that it is important to have completely inexperienced users test the product. There were many times during demo days when I would use another
    groups application and could not navigate it. For them it was easy because they had designed for their vision, but an outsider had no idea.
    Professor Harrison also showed us this at the beginning of the course through the video of someone testing ZipCar.</p>

    <h4>Communication</h4>

    <p>When you are designing a product on your own it can be far easier than working in a group because you don't need to communicate your vision
    to others. However in the HCI course we were constantly working in groups and communication was at the forefront. There were times in the term
        where someone in my group knew what they wanted to create, but our final product didn't live up to those expectations because the goals were
        not communicated effectively. In my projects this can be especially scene in <a href="https://medium.com/@matticoli/visualizing-the-corgis-music-dataset-36f02bdd51bc">Design for Understanding</a>.
    When a user navigates to the BPM Visualization tab their eyes are bombarded by information that's nearly impossible to discern. What it is meant
    to be communicated is that the more a state flashes the more average songs per artist that state has. An interesting visualization if displayed
    the correct way. Unfortunately in my group the person who had the idea for it was not the one who executed it. The problem was that the person who
    originated the idea was not able to communicate his vision to the person who created it. Talking about it later they suggested that it should
    have been organized so that more flashes were at the beginning. This would have displayed the data far better but a lack of internal communcation
    led to a poor product.</p>

    <h4>Interest</h4>

    <p>The fifth and final thing I learned from HCI was the value of being genuinely interested in what you are creating. I found that the projects
    that interested me were far easier than the ones that I was not as interested in. The first group project, <a href="https://medium.com/@cormac.collier/design-for-feedback-c212af828ccc">Design For Others</a>,
    had my interest immediately. I really like programming web pages, and although we were only prototyping a new design the challenge fascinated me.
    Because of this I found myself putting in far more effort and enjoying myself. I had the exact opposite reaction to <a href="https://medium.com/@corrinmcourville/design-for-tension-8fa1dcdc96dc">Design for Tension</a>.
    I found the idea of creating a chatbot using existing tools (FlowXO) to be a lot less interesting. Because of this every session working on it
    felt like a drag and I didn't get the same kind of experience out of it that I had gotten out of Design For Others. This taught me that if
    I am going to take on an ambitious challenge in the future, I should make sure it is something that interests me, otherwise it'll be far
    more difficult.</p>
