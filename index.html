    <h3>My HCI Experience</h3>
    <h2>Design Manifesto</h2>

    <p>CS 3733, HCI, proved extremely valuable through our learning about the design process. Learning aspects as we went and then
    applying them in the projects that followed, presented an opportunity real experience while designing.</p>

    <h4>Prototyping</h4>

    <p>One of the first aspects of the design process that we learned was prototyping. Our first group project, <a href="https://medium.com/@cormac.collier/design-for-feedback-c212af828ccc">Design For Others</a>
    , had a strong emphasis on prototyping, having redesign an existing website for a specific group of people. My group was assigned to
    redesign for 70+ year old seniors, and we choose the Worcester Public Library. Our final prototype was to redesign using an interactive
    prototyping tool, Invision. Getting experience with this taught me how vaulable it is to have not just a visual prototype, but rather
    one that you can apply your vision to and test how users can interact with it. In this project we also learned about the value of visual
    prototyping, sketching our early ideas on paper first. I was eager to get started using Invision, but if I had skipped the sketching phase,
    it would have made the next step much more difficult.</p>

    <h4>Design Tools</h4>

    <p>Another important point of designing that I learned throughout the course was how valuable it can be to have the right tools at your
    disposal while creating. This became especially apparent in <a href="https://medium.com/@corrinmcourville/design-for-tension-8fa1dcdc96dc">Design for Tension</a>
        and then later reinforced in <a href="">Design for Another World</a>. In Design for Tension my group used FlowXO to make our chat bot,
    but we quickly found out just how difficult it was to use. It was extremely unintuitive, and the only tutorial we could find was made by
    FlowXO and just as difficult to use. Because of the poor design tools, this project was more difficult than it should have been. It
    also made clear to me home important it is to design with the end user in mind. As a creator you have to sure that someone with no prior
    knowledge of the product would know how to use it. When we worked on Design For Another World the tool we used, A-Frame, was extremely
    easy to use and had tutorials that were extremely informative. This made the project far more enjoyable because we could focus on our vision,
    rather than struggling to create it.</p>
